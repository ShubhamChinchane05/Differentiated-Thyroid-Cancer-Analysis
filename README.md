ðŸ”¬ Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) Analysis using Machine Learning

	This notebook presents a structured machine learning workflow applied to a clinical dataset related to Differentiated Thyroid Cancer. The analysis includes:

1.	Data preprocessing:
â€¢	Handling duplicates and missing values
â€¢	Feature understanding and distribution analysis

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
â€¢	Visualizations of demographic and clinical variables (e.g., gender, smoking history, thyroid function, adenopathy)
â€¢	Distribution analysis to uncover potential feature-target relationships

3.	Model Development & Evaluation:
â€¢	Implementation of multiple supervised classification algorithms:
â€¢	Decision Tree
â€¢	Random Forest
â€¢	AdaBoost
â€¢	Logistic Regression
â€¢	Naive Bayes

4.	Performance evaluation using metrics such as:
â€¢	Accuracy
â€¢	Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
â€¢	Confusion Matrix
